      <p>Hey there! I'm Daan, I'm 17 years old and I live in The Netherlands. My interests are technology and philosophy, and I'm not afraid to combine those two either. Python is my current programming language of choice, but I also have knowledge of Haskell and JavaScript, and I'm planning on getting into Ruby. I've also been playing the double bass for 5 years, participating in a folk music band, among other things.</p>
      <p>This site is still under construction, so things might look a bit weird as I keep wrestling with CSS...</p>

        <p>...you're finally just enough skilled to use something however you want. That's one of the most awesome feelings to me, and really makes me want to keep learning something. Today, I had this realisation with CSS: I just finally <em>got it</em>: I now feel like I can style a page pretty much however I want, and when the CSS doesn't behave as expected, I can fix it myself.</p>
        <p>This evening I fixed the projects section, which I had some trouble with yesterday. It turns out, because I had the <code>.column</code> divs within an anchor, they were all the first child of that anchor. The CSS boilerplate I'm using, <a href="https://www.getskeleton.com">Skeleton</a>, uses the <code>:first-child</code> pseudoclass to remove the left margin from the first column in a row, but that got applied to all the columns. So I fixed that by putting a div around the anchors, and removing the inner divs, because they weren't really necessary.</p>
        <p>I also added some nice transitions to the project buttons, which turned out to be surprisingly easy to do. They now fade to red very nicely when you hover over them. I also changed the body font to Roboto Slab, which looks pretty classy if you ask me. :P</p>
        <p>I'm not done with this page yet though, take a look at the to do list above. But I'm a lot less frustrated by CSS now. I still feel a bit <em>meh</em> about web programming though. But that's a topic for another time.</p>

        <p>My buddy ~niels has now joined tilde.red as well! Don't mind his fugly page, he's just kinda n00by at HTML. (Look at the source, it's seriously full of <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tags...) He's really good at physics though, so you can ask him a lot about that.</p>
